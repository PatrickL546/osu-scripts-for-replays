# About The Project
I wanted a way to download files from beatmap ID but cannot find a way so I made scripts for it. `Truncate replay.py` makes it easier to check for duplicate replay files

# Requirements
 - Windows 10 for powershell scripts
 - Python 3.8.0+ (https://www.python.org/)
 - Additional library listed in requirements.txt

# Scripts
 - Get MD5 hash of beatmaps from replay.ps1
 - Get beatmapset ID by MD5 hash.py
 - Open replay.ps1
 - osu! map downloader by ID.py
 - Truncate replay.py
